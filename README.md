<h2>Overview of the Tour (Core Event)</h2>

<p>
  The tour is an 18-step interactive "Museum of Bad Decisions" gauntlet with
  escalating chaos, fake-outs, and hostile UI energy.
</p>

<p>
  You'll go through weird decision prompts, moving interface behavior, and
  three themed challenge moments, then end with a personalized certificate and
  diagnostics recap.
</p>

<p>
  It's designed to feel unpredictable, annoying, funny, and just barely
  survivable, with lots of visual/audio madness and intentionally unreliable
  feedback throughout.
</p>

<p>
  If you like cursed UX and chaotic game-like web experiences, this is exactly
  that.
