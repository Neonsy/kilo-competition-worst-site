# Active Context: Museum of Bad Decisions

## Current State

**Project Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - The Museum of Bad Decisions is fully built and functional!

A deliberately awful website that masquerades as an interactive museum of terrible ideas. The core functionality (Tour Wizard) works perfectly while every aspect of UX/UI is designed to frustrate, confuse, and amuse users.

- [x] Exhibits page with grid/list/chaos view modes
- [x] Tour Wizard with 8 hostile questions
- [x] Regret Certificate with fake download
